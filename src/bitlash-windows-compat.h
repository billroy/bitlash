 * If the pin is configured as an INPUT, writing a HIGH value with digitalWrite() will enable an internal

 * resistor is enough to light an LED dimly, so if LEDs appear to work, but very dimly, this is a likely

 * \note Digital pin PIN_LED is harder to use as a digital input than the other digital pins because it has an LED
 * and resistor attached to it that's soldered to the board on most boards. If you enable its internal 20k pull-up
 * resistor, it will hang at around 1.7 V instead of the expected 5V because the onboard LED and series resistor
 * pull the voltage level down, meaning it always returns LOW. If you must use pin PIN_LED as a digital input, use an
